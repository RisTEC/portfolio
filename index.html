        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hi, I’m Rishit, a second-year game design and development student at Rochester Institute of Technology. 
            At 16, I published my first game, Monstir Iradicator, on Steam, starting my journey into game development. 
            Growing up, video games played a huge role in helping me connect with people and make friends, Today, I aspire to create games 
            that have the ability to bring players together in meaningful ways.
            <br>
            <br>
            Below is a collection of my recent work. Feel free to reach out. I’m always excited to collaborate or discuss new ideas!
        </p>

                <h3>Old School Fishing (2024)</h3>
                <p> 
                    Genre: Fishing, Arcade, Mini-games<br>
                    Tools: JavaScript, PixiJS, HTML, CSS<br>
                    <br>
                    Old School Fishing is a simple wave based 2D fishing game where the objective is to catch as many fish as possible 
                    without failing to reel a fish in. This game was made for an Intro to Game Web Tech class using JavaScript and 
                    utilized PixiJS as a rendering framework.  
                    I worked on aspects of the game like creating the core mechanics like the casting mechanic, the wave system and 
                    the reeling in minigame.

                <h3>Fish Pond Simulation (2024)</h3>
                <p> 
                    Tools: Unity, C#<br>
                    <br>
                    The Fish Pond Simulation was made for an Interactive Media Development class. It uses autonomous agents to 
                    create a simulate an ecosystem. The fishes utilizes behaviors such as wandering, fleeing from a player controlled fish, 
                    and arriving towards food. This was made in Unity and the behaviors were programmed in C#. I worked on aspects like
                    creating the behavioural scripts and player interaction.
